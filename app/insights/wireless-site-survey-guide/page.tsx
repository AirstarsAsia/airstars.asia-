          A wireless site survey is the foundation of enterprise-grade Wi-Fi performance. Without proper 
          RF planning, even the most expensive access points will deliver poor coverage and unreliable 
          connectivity. Here's why professional surveys matter and how they transform your wireless network.

          The Cost of Poor Wi-Fi Planning
        </h2>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Most businesses approach Wi-Fi deployment by purchasing access points and placing them where 
          power outlets exist. This approach leads to dead zones, interference, poor performance, and 
          frustrated users. The cost of retrofitting a poorly designed network often exceeds the 
          original deployment budget.

            <li>Inconsistent coverage with dead zones and weak signal areas</li>

          Types of Wireless Site Surveys
        </h2>
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mt-8 mb-4">
          Predictive Survey (Pre-Deployment)
        </h3>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Using specialized software and building floor plans, predictive surveys model RF propagation 
          to determine optimal AP placement before installation. This approach provides initial design 
          guidance and helps estimate equipment requirements and costs.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mt-8 mb-4">
          Passive Survey (Post-Deployment)
        </h3>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Passive surveys measure existing RF conditions without connecting to the network. This method 
          identifies coverage gaps, interference sources, and signal strength variations throughout 
          the facility. It's essential for validating predictive models and troubleshooting performance issues.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mt-8 mb-4">
          Active Survey (Performance Validation)
        </h3>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Active surveys connect to the wireless network and measure real-world performance including 
          throughput, latency, and roaming behavior. This comprehensive approach validates that the 
          network meets business requirements under actual usage conditions.

          Physical Site Assessment
        </h3>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Professional surveyors examine building construction materials, ceiling types, HVAC systems, 
          and potential interference sources. Metal studs, concrete walls, and large machinery all 
          affect RF propagation and must be considered in the design.

          Spectrum Analysis
        </h3>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Before deploying Wi-Fi, it's crucial to understand the existing RF environment. Spectrum 
          analyzers identify interference from microwave ovens, Bluetooth devices, wireless cameras, 
          and other 2.4GHz and 5GHz sources that could impact performance.

          Coverage and Capacity Planning
        </h3>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Professional surveys balance coverage (signal strength) with capacity (user density). 
          High-density areas like conference rooms need different AP placement strategies than 
          open office spaces or warehouses.

          Frequency Band Strategy
        </h3>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Modern networks should prioritize 5GHz and 6GHz bands for data traffic while using 2.4GHz 
          for IoT devices and legacy equipment. Proper channel planning prevents co-channel interference 
          and maximizes available spectrum efficiency.

          Coverage Boundary Control
        </h3>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Professional surveys ensure Wi-Fi signals don't extend unnecessarily beyond building 
          boundaries, reducing the attack surface for unauthorized access attempts. Strategic 
          AP placement and power control minimize signal leakage.

          Rogue AP Detection Planning
        </h3>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Survey design should include sensor placement for wireless intrusion detection systems. 
          Proper sensor coverage ensures detection of rogue access points and unauthorized wireless 
          devices throughout the facility.

        </h3>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          After installation, validation surveys confirm that the network meets design requirements. 
          This includes throughput testing, roaming validation, and application performance verification 
          under realistic usage conditions.

          ROI of Professional Site Surveys
        </h2>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          While site surveys represent an upfront investment, they typically save money by preventing 
          over-provisioning, reducing support calls, and ensuring optimal performance from day one. 
          The cost of a professional survey is often less than the price of a single enterprise access point.

          When to Conduct Site Surveys
        </h2>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Site surveys should be performed before any significant wireless deployment, during office 
          relocations, when experiencing performance issues, or when adding new applications with 
          different requirements. Regular surveys also help maintain optimal performance as the 
          RF environment changes over time.
