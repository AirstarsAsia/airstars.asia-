          Small businesses are increasingly targeted by cybercriminals who view them as easy targets 
          with valuable data but limited security resources. Many security breaches result from 
          common, preventable mistakes that can be addressed with proper planning and implementation.

          The Small Business Security Landscape
        </h2>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          According to recent studies, 43% of cyberattacks target small businesses, yet only 14% 
          are prepared to defend themselves. The average cost of a data breach for small businesses 
          exceeds $200,000, and 60% of companies go out of business within six months of a major 
          security incident.

          Mistake #1: Weak Password Policies

          The Problem
        </h3>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Many small businesses still rely on simple passwords, shared accounts, or default credentials. 
          Common passwords like "password123" or company names with years can be cracked in seconds 
          using automated tools.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mt-8 mb-4">
          The Solution
        </h3>
        <div className="bg-green-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6">
          <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-green-800 mb-3">Strong Password Policy Elements:</h4>

          The Problem
        </h3>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Cybercriminals actively exploit known vulnerabilities in outdated software. Many successful 
          attacks target vulnerabilities that have patches available but haven't been applied. 
          This includes operating systems, applications, firmware, and security tools.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mt-8 mb-4">
          The Solution
        </h3>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-slate-700 space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li><strong>Automated patch management:</strong> Use tools like Windows Update for Business or third-party solutions</li>
          <li><strong>Vulnerability scanning:</strong> Regular scans to identify missing patches</li>
          <li><strong>Patch testing:</strong> Test critical updates in a staging environment first</li>
          <li><strong>Emergency patching procedures:</strong> Rapid deployment for critical security updates</li>
          <li><strong>End-of-life planning:</strong> Replace unsupported software and hardware</li>

          Default Router Configurations
        </h3>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Many businesses use consumer-grade routers with default settings, weak Wi-Fi passwords, 
          and no network segmentation. This creates a flat network where compromising one device 
          provides access to everything.

          The Problem
        </h3>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Ransomware attacks have made data backup critical for business survival. However, many 
          small businesses have incomplete backups, untested recovery procedures, or backups that 
          are accessible to the same credentials used for daily operations.

          Employees are often the weakest link in security, not due to malicious intent but lack 
          of awareness. Phishing emails, social engineering, and unsafe browsing habits can 
          compromise even well-secured networks.

          Many small businesses give employees administrative access to systems they don't need, 
          or fail to remove access when roles change. This violates the principle of least

          The Problem
        </h3>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          When security incidents occur, businesses without response plans often make costly mistakes 
          like paying ransoms, destroying evidence, or failing to contain the breach quickly. 
          The first few hours after detection are critical for minimizing damage.

        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Personal devices accessing business data create security gaps that many small businesses

          Security isn't just about technologyâ€”it's about creating a culture where everyone 
          understands their role in protecting the business. This requires leadership commitment, 
          regular communication, and making security part of daily operations rather than an 
          afterthought.

          The Cost of Inaction
        </h2>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          While implementing comprehensive security measures requires investment, the cost of a 
          security breach far exceeds prevention costs. Beyond financial losses, businesses face 
          reputation damage, regulatory fines, and potential closure. Proactive security is 
          always more cost-effective than reactive incident response.
