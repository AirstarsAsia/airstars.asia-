          The Core Difference: Philosophy and Approach
        </h2>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Google Workspace emphasizes simplicity, real-time collaboration, and cloud-first design. 
          Microsoft 365 focuses on feature-rich applications, desktop integration, and enterprise-grade functionality. 
          Understanding this fundamental difference helps determine which platform aligns with your business culture.

          Email and Communication
        </h2>
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mt-8 mb-4">
          Gmail vs Outlook
        </h3>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Gmail offers a clean, search-focused interface that most users find intuitive. Its conversation threading 
          and powerful search capabilities make email management effortless. Outlook provides more traditional email 
          organization with folders, rules, and calendar integration that appeals to users coming from desktop email clients.
        </p>
        
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mt-8 mb-4">
          Video Conferencing
        </h3>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Google Meet integrates seamlessly with Calendar and Gmail, offering reliable video quality and easy screen sharing. 
          Microsoft Teams goes beyond video calls, functioning as a comprehensive collaboration hub with chat, file sharing, 
          and app integrations.

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-12 mb-6">
          Document Creation and Collaboration
        </h2>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides excel at real-time collaboration. Multiple users can edit simultaneously 
          with changes appearing instantly. The revision history is comprehensive and easy to navigate.
        </p>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint offer more advanced formatting and feature sets. While collaboration 
          has improved significantly, it still feels more structured than Google's fluid approach. Excel remains 
          the gold standard for complex spreadsheet work.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-12 mb-6">
          Storage and File Management
        </h2>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Google Drive provides 30GB per user (Business Starter) with unlimited storage on higher plans. 
          File sharing is intuitive, and the search functionality is exceptional.
        </p>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          OneDrive offers 1TB per user across all business plans. Integration with Windows File Explorer 
          makes it feel like a natural extension of the desktop experience.

          Security and Compliance
        </h2>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Both platforms offer enterprise-grade security, but with different approaches. Google emphasizes 
          AI-powered threat detection and zero-trust security models. Microsoft provides more granular 
          administrative controls and compliance tools, making it popular with regulated industries.
