              What started as a focused wireless networking consultancy has evolved into comprehensive 
              small business IT support. My journey began with a deep specialization in Wi-Fi infrastructure, 
              earning certifications as a Certified Wireless Network Professional (CWNP) including the 
              challenging Certified Wireless Network Administrator, Planning, and Security certifications.

              Today, I organically grow with my clients, supporting everything from secure wireless deployments 
              to complete workspace solutions. Whether it's designing enterprise-grade Wi-Fi networks, 
              managing Mac deployments, optimizing Google Workspace and Microsoft 365 environments, 
              or integrating the countless devices that keep small businesses runningâ€”I've touched every 
              aspect of modern business IT.

              My approach is simple: be the reliable IT partner that small businesses need, 
              bringing enterprise-level expertise to organizations that deserve better than 
              one-size-fits-all solutions.
